# EmoTracker Pack (map + items) for OoTMM

## Usage

- Install [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net/download/).
- [Download the current tracker pack version](https://github.com/jupiter0fire/OoTMMR_tracker_pack/releases/latest/download/OoTMMR_tracker_pack.zip) from [releases](https://github.com/jupiter0fire/OoTMMR_tracker_pack/releases) and place the `OoTMMR_tracker_pack.zip` in the "packs" subfolder in your `[user]/Documents/EmoTracker` folder. If you have not used EmoTracker before, it is safe to manually create the "packs" folder.
- Open EmoTracker and select "OotMM Randomizer" under `"Installed Packages" -> "Others"` in the settings menu.

Green markings indicate that a check is logically reachable. Yellow markings mean that the check is reachable with a trick that is not enabled in the settings. Orange markings indicate that at a location some checks are reachable and others are not.

## Notes

- The events for **OOT Malon**, **OOT Zelda's Letter**, **MM Bomber's Notebook**, **MM Seahorse**, **MM Zora Eggs** and **MM Frogs** are depicted as locations in the tracker pack and must be manually tracked before the checks that depend on these events are shown as reachable (e.g. checks in Pinnacle Rock depending on getting MM Seahorse).

- **Goron Lullaby** is a progressive item if the respective setting (progressive Goron Lullaby) is enabled.

- **MM Hookshot** is a progressive item if the respective setting (MM Short Hookshot) is enabled.

- **MM Ocarina** is a progressive item if the respective setting (MM Fairy Ocarina) is enabled.

- If you play with the setting **shared Ocarinas** but without the **MM Fairy Ocarina**, once you receive the Fairy Ocarina, it will be displayed for Majora's Mask. However, you can only use an Ocarina in Majora's Mask once you have found the Ocarina of Time for both games.

- **Small Key Sanity** is a tracker setting because OOT Fire Temple logic depends on that setting. You still need to track your Small Keys manually even if Small Key Sanity is not activated.

- Having **MM Spin Attack** can be tracked by right clicking on the MM Kokiri Sword.

- If you are playing with **Child Wallets**, right click on the respective wallet. The tracker pack starts with the 99 rupee wallet by default.

## Unsupported Settings

- Dungeon Reward Shuffle Anywhere
- Boss Entrance Shuffle

- MQ Dungeons

## TODOs:
